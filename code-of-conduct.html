											<br>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h4><b>&nbsp; Last updated: February 02, 2017</b></h4>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Ever since the foundation of Yashasvi Information Solutions Pvt Ltd (Yashasvi) in 2006, ethics have been a fundamental way of how we work.
													Honesty, integrity, and openness have always been among our top priorities. We believe that an integrated approach to governance, ethics,
													risk and compliance strengthens our values and promotes how we do business. All business dealings are carried out with transparency and integrity.
													It is easy to say what we must do, but the proof is in our actions. Ultimately, we will be judged on what we do.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Transparency</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													At Yashasvi everyone should feel comfortable to speak his or her mind, particularly with respect to ethics concerns.
													Managers have a responsibility to create an open and supportive environment where employees feel comfortable raising such questions.
													We all benefit tremendously when employees exercise their power to prevent mistakes or wrongdoing by asking the right questions at the right times.
													Any ethics specific serious concerns, which are dealt at a high level within the organization.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Respect for the Individual</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													We all deserve to work in an environment where we are treated with dignity and respect. Yashasvi is committed to creating such an environment
													because it brings out the full potential in each of us, which, in turn, contributes directly to our business success.
													We cannot afford to let anyone’s talents go to waste.
												</li>
												<li>
													Yashasvi is an equal employment employer and is committed to providing a workplace that is free of discrimination of all types from abusive, offensive or harassing behaviour.
													Any employee who feels harassed or discriminated against should report the incident to his or her manager.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Set Tone at the Top</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Management has the added responsibility for demonstrating, through their actions, the importance of this Code. In any business, ethical behaviour does not simply happen;
													it is the product of clear and direct communication of behavioural expectations, modelled from the top and demonstrated by example.
													Again, ultimately, our actions are what matters.  To make our Code work, managers must be responsible for promptly addressing ethical
													questions or concerns raised by employees and for taking the appropriate steps to deal with such issues in an impartial fashion.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Uphold the Law</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Yashasvi commitment to integrity begins with complying with laws, rules and regulations where we do business. Further, each of us must have an understanding of the company policies,
													laws, rules and regulations that apply to our specific roles. We are responsible for preventing violations of law and for speaking up if
													we see possible violations.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Competition</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													We are dedicated to ethical, fair and vigorous competition. We will sell products and services based on their merit, superior quality, functionality and competitive pricing.
													We will not offer or solicit improper payments or gratuities in connection with the purchase of goods or services for Yashasvi or the sales of products or services,
													nor will we engage or assist in unlawful boycotts of particular customers.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Proprietary Information</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													It is important that we respect the property rights of others and we will maintain the confidentiality of client’s information.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Selective Disclosure</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													We will not selectively disclose (whether in one-on-one or small discussions, meetings, presentations, proposals or otherwise) any material non-public information with respect to Yashasvi,
													its business, plans, financial condition, or any development plan. We should be particularly vigilant when making presentations or proposals to customers
													to ensure that our presentations do not contain material non-public information.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Conflicts of Interest</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													We must avoid any relationship or activity that might impair, or even appear to impair, our ability to make objective and fair decisions when performing our jobs.
													At times, we may be faced with situations where the business actions we take on behalf of Yashasvi may conflict with our own personal or family interests because of
													the course of action that is best for us personally may not also be the best course to engage without disclosure.
												</li>
												<li>
													Here are some other ways in which conflicts of interest could arise:
													<ol>
														<li>
															Being employed (you or a close family member) by, or acting as a consultant to, a competitor or potential competitor, supplier or contractor,
															regardless of the nature of the employment, while you are employed with Yashasvi.
														</li>
														<li>
															Hiring or supervising family members or closely related persons.
														</li>
														<li>
															Serving as a board member for an outside commercial company or organization.
														</li>
														<li>
															Owning or having a substantial interest in a competitor, supplier or contractor.
														</li>
														<li>
															Having a personal interest, financial interest or potential gain in any Yashasvi transaction.
														</li>
														<li>
															Placing company business with a firm owned or controlled by a Yashasvi employee or his or her family.
														</li>
														<li>
															Accepting gifts, discounts, favors or services from a customer/potential customer, competitor or supplier,
															unless equally available to all Yashasvi employees.
														</li>
													</ol>
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Gifts, Gratuities and Business Courtesies</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Yashasvi is committed to competing solely on a merit of products and services. We should avoid any actions that create a perception that
													favourable treatment of outside entities by Yashasvi was sought, received or given in exchange for personal business courtesies.
													Business courtesies include gifts, gratuities, meals, refreshments, entertainment or other benefits from persons or companies with whom
													Yashasvi does or may do business.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Accepting Business Courtesies</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Most business courtesies offered to us in the course of our employment are offered because of our positions at Yashasvi.
													We should not feel any entitlement to accept and keep a business courtesy.
												</li>
												<li>
													Employees who award contracts or who can influence the allocation of business, who create specifications that result in the placement of business
													or who participate in negotiation of contracts must be particularly careful to avoid actions that create the appearance of favouritism or
													that may adversely affect the company’s reputation for impartiality and fair dealing.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Meals, Refreshments and Entertainment</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													We may accept occasional meals, refreshments, entertainment and similar business courtesies that are shared with the person who has
													offered to pay for the meal or entertainment, provided that:
													<ol>
														<li>They are not inappropriately lavish or excessive.</li>
														<li>
															The courtesies are not frequent and do not reflect a pattern of frequent acceptance of courtesies from the same person or entity.
														</li>
														<li>
															The courtesy does not create the appearance of an attempt to influence business decisions, such as accepting courtesies or
															entertainment from a supplier whose contract is expiring in the near future.
														</li>
														<li>
															The employee accepting the business courtesy would not feel uncomfortable discussing the courtesy with his or her
															manager or co-worker or having the courtesies known by the public.
														</li>
													</ol>
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Offering Business Courtesies</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Any employee who offers a business courtesy must assure that it cannot reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to gain an unfair
													business advantage or otherwise reflect negatively upon Yashasvi. An employee may never use personal funds or resources to do
													something that cannot be done with Yashasvi resources. Accounting for business courtesies must be done in accordance with approved
													company procedures.
												</li>
												<li>
													We may provide non-monetary gifts (i.e., company logo apparel or similar promotional items) to our customers. Further, management may
													approve other courtesies, including meals, refreshments or entertainment of reasonable value, provided that:
												</li>
												<li>
													<ol>
														<li>The practice does not violate any law or regulation or the standards of conduct of the recipient’s organization.</li>
														<li>
															The business courtesy is consistent with industry practice, is infrequent in nature and is not lavish.
														</li>
														<li>
															The business courtesy is properly reflected on the books and records of Yashasvi
														</li>
													</ol>
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Accurate Public Disclosures</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													We will make certain that all disclosures made in financial reports and public documents are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable.
													This obligation applies to all employees, including all financial executives, with any responsibility for the preparation for such reports,
													including drafting, reviewing and signing or certifying the information contained therein.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Corporate Recordkeeping</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													We create, retain and dispose of our company records as part of our normal course of business in compliance with all regulatory and legal requirements.
												</li>
												<li>
													All corporate records must be true, accurate and complete, and company data must be promptly and accurately entered in our books in accordance with
													applicable accounting principles. We must not interfere with any auditors engaged to perform to audit of Yashasvi books, records, process or internal controls.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Accountability</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Each of us is responsible for knowing and adhering to the values and standards set forth in this Code and for raising questions if we are uncertain about company policy.
													If we are concerned whether the standards are being met or are aware of violations of the Code, we must contact the Manager.
													Yashasvi takes seriously the standards set forth in the Code, and violations are cause for disciplinary action up to and including
													termination of employment.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Use of Company Resources</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Company resources, including time, material, equipment and information, are provided for company business use. Employees and those who represent
													Yashasvi are trusted to behave responsibly and use good judgment to conserve company assets and we reserves the right to monitor or
													review all information on a company-issued assets.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<header>
											<img class="point "src="images/point.svg" alt="point" width="25" height="25" /><h3><b>&nbsp; Media Inquiries</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Yashasvi community, and from time to time, employees may be approached by reporters and other members of the media.
													In order to ensure that we speak with one voice and provide accurate information about the company, we should direct all media inquiries
													to info[at]yashasvi.co.in . No one may issue a press release without consulting marketing.
